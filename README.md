Diamond DMS is a document management system forked from Krystal DMS and licensed under GPLv3.

After using Krystal DMS for some time I ended up fixing and improving so many things that I felt others should be able to use the improved version.

For now this project is distributed as "source-only." It can be compiled easily with eclipse-jdt and the new jars and files copied over the base installation available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/krystaldms/.
